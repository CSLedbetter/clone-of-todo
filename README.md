# Very Simple Todo App

In this repo I've provided a base implementation of a very simple todo app written in AngularJS. Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to complete the app by completing the remaining tasks outlined below.

## Tasks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and reinstall bower components and node modules.
```
$ cd <your_dev_folder>
$ git clone https://github.com/cameronwilby/vstda-ng1.git
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

2. Test that the app works using `reload`
```
$ reload .
```

3. Style the markup and make it look good (Feel free to change the HTML)
4. Store todos in a backend web service instead of the local VM. (Refer to video for guidance)
5. Deploy the app to Heroku (Refer to video for guidance)
